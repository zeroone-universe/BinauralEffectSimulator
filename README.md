# Binaural Effect Simulator

This is a repository for a simple binaural effect simulator, designed to simulate spatial audio effects using headphones. This code was developed for the final project of the Sound Design and Programming course at GIST in 2021.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply follow the instructions on binaural_effect.ipynb, which are written in Korean.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need:

- ipython==8.12.0
- librosa==0.10.0.post2
- numpy==1.23.5
- pydub==0.25.1
- PyQt5==5.15.9
- soundfile==0.12.1

To automatically install these libraries, run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Notes

A final presentation document in Korean about this implementation is attached in a PDF format. However, there may be some differences between the presentation document and the implementation due to the conversion of .py files to .ipynb files.
